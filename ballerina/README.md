## Overview

This module provides the URL encoding/decoding functions.

URL encoding stands for encoding certain characters in a URL by replacing them with one or more character triplets that consist of the percent character `%` followed by two hexadecimal digits. The two hexadecimal digits of the triplet(s) represent the numeric value of the replaced character.

The Ballerina `url` module facilitates APIs to encode and decode a URL or part of a URL.
